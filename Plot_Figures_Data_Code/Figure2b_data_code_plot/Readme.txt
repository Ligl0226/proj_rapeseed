Readme:

We constructed a genomic regulating ASV network based on the identified QTL, hotspot regions, and significant TWAS genes. The connections between nodes, including QTLs, Hotspots, Genes, and ASVs were visualized using Gephi v0.10 ( https://github.com/gephi/gephi ).

The plotting file “KFandYL_ASV_GWAS_TWAS_eGWAS.v02.gephi” was created with software Gephi v0.10, using the nodes and edges files supplied by the authors as input. The script “R03.KFandYL_Network_nodes_edges_Prepare.R” was used to generate the node and edge files.
